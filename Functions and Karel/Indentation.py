"""
Indentation
It is nothing but the lines of space between defining the function and the another lines of code which is inside the function
Like in defining the function there should be 4 points space
And similarly inside the function if we have used the if or any other condition inside it then there will be atleast 8 points space
ex-
def my_function():
    print("hello") #here 4 points space
    print("bye")


def my_function():
    print("hello")
    print("bye")
    if sky == "clear":
        print("blue") #here 8 points space
